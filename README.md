# SwiftBenchmarks
Comparisons between NS Foundation and Swift classes, used inside Swift projects

To run these benchmarks yourself, clone this repository, open the project in Xcode and take a look at the``` SwiftBenchmarkingTests/SwiftBenchmarkingTests.swift``` file. Run the test you want first and then set the result as the baseline. Then comment out the baseline method and comment in the method you want to compare against and Xcode will tell you how much better/worse it is. You might be surprised by the results...
